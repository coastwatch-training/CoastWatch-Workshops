NOAA CoastWatch is hosting this free, virtual training class Viewing and Analyzing Ocean/Coastal Events and Water Quality Using Satellites.


## Course Description
Many satellite products are available for water quality applications and other uses from NOAA and other data providers. These include: chlorophyll, turbidity, sea surface temperature, organic matter, and more. 
In this course, learn how to use these satellite products for your region of interest using freely available tools. Address your needs and questions by creating maps and images, plotting a time series of varying conditions, or creating a virtual buoy for your study location. And other applications too!

This class is being offered in **_two Tiers_** as part of a larger Long Island Sound Project funded by New York/Connecticut Sea Grant. 


## Objectives

### Tier I: Creating Images
Learn to use tools to create images and maps of ocean or coastal features in your area of interest.
Tools taught: CoastWatch Portal, ArcGIS, ERDDAP visualization server, and more.

### Tier II: Analyzing Data for Your Study or Region 
Work more analytically with oceanographic satellite data. 
Learn R and/or Python techniques to access data on ERDDAP data servers for data extraction, map creation, time series analysis, matching data to your study site locations or ship tracks, creating a virtual buoy using satellite data in your location of choice, and other application skills.
